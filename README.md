# capstone_project
This is my final project for the ALX program

I will create an app to manage the personel of an Air Force Base.

This app will be able to give:
- the complete list of military employed on the base 
- Their ranks, their functions and other important information related to their familiy
- we will track also their diploma (military diploma and civilian degree)
- we will create a profile file providing their PII: Personal Identifiable Information


We will add features like:
- adding or creating new personnel(military)
- deleting personnel
- modifying and update the information on a military
- searching a military using his name or his registration number
